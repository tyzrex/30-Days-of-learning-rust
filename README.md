# 30 Days Rust Challenge - By Sulav Baral

Welcome to my 30 Days Rust Challenge! ðŸ¦€

## Overview

This repository is where I'll be documenting my journey as I take on the 30-day challenge to enhance my Rust programming skills. Whether I'm a beginner looking to learn Rust or an experienced developer aiming to deepen my understanding, this challenge is tailor-made for me! Each day, I'll be tackling a new task or concept, accompanied by explanations, examples, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To join me on this challenge, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/30-days-rust-challenge.git
```

## Daily Tasks
Each day, I'll find a new task in the day-X directories, where X represents the day number. Inside each directory, I'll discover a README.md file containing instructions for the day's challenge, along with any accompanying code or resources.

## How to Contribute
While I'm mainly doing this challenge for personal growth, I'm open to suggestions for improvements, new challenges, or corrections. Feel free to reach out if you have any ideas to make this challenge even better!
